# bootstrap-portfolio

## Description
This project is a webpage showcasing my portfolio of projects. It is designed in a way that I can continuously update it with projects I make in the future. You can view the deployed application via this link: https://rdatkinson.github.io/bootstrap-portfolio/

## Installation
N/A

## Usage
This project is designed for future potential employers, or of course those who are curious, to view my portfolio. Since I do not have many projects yet (more to come as I continue in my front-end bootcamp!), I have put a link to my SoundCloud in one of the cards, and two placeholder cards. All 3 will be updated with web dev projects in due course. The layout is designed to be easy to navigate, and I used Bootstrap framework components like Jumbotron, Cards and Containers, along with custom CSS styling over the top (colours, sizing, flexbox etc) through an external stylesheet, to get the effect shown in the screenshot below.
