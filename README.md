# bootstrap-portfolio

## Description
This project is a webpage showcasing my portfolio of projects. It is designed in a way that I can continuously update it with projects I make in the future. You can view the deployed application via this link: https://rdatkinson.github.io/bootstrap-portfolio/

## Installation
N/A

## Usage
This project is designed for future potential employers, or of course those who are curious, to view my portfolio. The layout is designed to be easy to navigate, and I used the Bootstrap framework, along with custom CSS styling over the top (colours, sizing, flexbox etc), to get the effect shown in the screenshot below.
